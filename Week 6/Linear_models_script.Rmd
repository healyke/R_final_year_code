When we have 2 or more continuous variables that we often want to know how they 
are related to one another. For example, we might want to know whether larger 
values of body mass are associated with longer lifespans.

In this script we will look at some basic correlation tests before running some 
linear models which consists of fitting lines to two or more continuous 
variables. 

Here we will test the relationship between penguin body mass and flipper length.
Our hypothesis will be that larger penguins have longer flippers. The NULL is
that there is no difference in flipper length in penguins of different size.

# Data
We will need to upload the penguin data set for this so set your directory to
the folder with the downloaded dataset called penguin_1_10_2023.csv

```{r pen data}

pen_data <- read.csv("penguin_1_10_2023.csv")

```

# Data cleaning

If you look at the dataset you might notice some NA values. These are missing
values which were either not recorded or not input in the original dataset. 
These are normal but we should deal with them before we start our analysis.

Here we will use the na.omit() function which will drop every row with an NA.
We should be careful with this as if a row has an NA for any column it will be
dropped even if we don't plan on using the column with the NA. To avoid this
we will create a subset of the variables we want in our analysis. In this case
lets just use species, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and sex. First we will
subset and then we will remove all the rows with NAs.


```{r subset}

#Subset the data
pen_subset <- data.frame(species = pen_data$species, 
                         flipper_length_mm = pen_data$flipper_length_mm,
                         body_mass_g = pen_data$body_mass_g,
                         sex = pen_data$sex)

#remove rows with NAs in them
#Notice I overwrote pen_subset after removing the na, this is fine but be 
#careful and avoid overwriting the original data you imported.

pen_subset <- na.omit(pen_subset)

```


# Plotting

One of the first things you should always do before running an analysis is to 
plot your data. This will give you an idea of not only what relationships might
be there but also a feel for what the distributions of the data look like. Lets
first do a histogram of each of the continuous variables. 

```{r hist}

hist(pen_subset$flipper_length_mm,
     xlab = "flipper length")

hist(pen_subset$body_mass_g,
     xlab = "bosy mass")

```

While body mass looks normally distributed flipper length looks bimodal. Thats 
ok for now but something we will keep in mind and explore later.

Next we will use a scatter plot to look at how the two continuous variables 
relate to one another. In our hypothesis we state that we think larger penguins 
have longer flippers so we think being larger is what leads to having longer 
flippers and not the other way around. This means body size is our explanatory variable while flipper length is the response variable. The explanotory varaible
will always go on the x-axis with the response on the y-axis.

```{r scatterplot}

plot(pen_subset$flipper_length_mm ~ pen_subset$body_mass_g,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "Body Mass (g)",
     ylab = "Flipper length (mm)",
     bty = "n")


```

From the plot we can see a clear trend, with bigger individuals having longer
flippers. However, we can check using models whether this is a significant trend.


# Pearson correlation test
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is a common way of measuring a linear 
correlation. It is a number between â€“1 and 1 that measures the strength and 
direction of the relationship between two variables. It works by calculating how 
close the residuals are to the best line of fit.

We can use the cor() function R. Notice this function reads in the variables as 
cor(X-axis, Y-axis).




```{r cor}

cor_test <- cor(pen_subset$body_mass_g,
                pen_subset$flipper_length_mm)
cor_test

```

The value of 0.87 indicates that there is a strong positive relationship 
between. 

We could also estimate how the fit of this correlation, if its a good 
fit it would mean the data cluster very tightly together into a line, if the 
fit is poor the data will be spread out more like a cloud. One common measure of
this is the r-squared value. It is the square of the correlation value but can 
be thought of as a measure of how far away the data are from a fitted line which
we will see later. It has a value between 0 (completely random data) to 1 (data 
completely fit along some line or model). Lets calualte it here.

```{r r-squared}

cor_test^2

```

This is a high R-squared so it indicates a good fit for the correlation. We will
see this value again later in the linear model.

Overall these correlation values are very limited in that it does not tell us 
how much flipper length changes with body size. For example, I might want to 
know how much longer I should expected a flipper to be if I increase the body 
mass of a penguin by one gram. To do that we need to use linear models


# linear models

Linear models work by trying to find some line that best fits the some data. To
do so it tries to estimate at least 2 parameters that describe a line, the 
intercept and the slope. The equation of a line is y = Mx + c where c is the 
intercept and M is the slope, with y and x representing our explanatory (x) and 
response variables (y). If we know the intercept and slope we can estimate what
y value we expect for any given x value.

We could manually try and fit our own lines to the data trying to get as close
as we can. Lets try do it for three separate lines. We will show the full graph 
here so you can see the intercepts clearly and use the abline() function which
plots lines according to abline(intercept, slope)



```{r ablines}

plot(pen_subset$flipper_length_mm ~ pen_subset$body_mass_g,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "Body Mass (g)",
     ylab = "Flipper length (mm)",
     bty = "n",
     ylim = c(0, 230),
     xlim = c(0, 6500))

#line with intercept of 0 and a slope of 1
#abline()
abline (0,1, 
        col = "coral")
#This line seems way too step so lets try a smaller slope and a higher intercept


#line with intercept of 100 and a slope of 10
abline (100,0.01, 
        col = "blue4")
#The slope seems about right but we still need a higher intercept

#line with intercept of 100 and a slope of 10
abline (155,0.012, 
        col = "green4")
#The slope seems about right

```

I could use the green line as my model to describe the data which could be 
written as y = 0.012x + 155. This means if I found a penguin that weighed 4000g
my model would predict its flippers to be y = 0.012(4000) + 155  which is 
y = 203cm. This is called the expected value. 

However, we can probably find a better line of fit and to do so we can use the 
idea of maximum likelihood. For linear model we simply pick the line which is 
closest to the data or more specifically reduces the distance to the residuals 
the most. This is called maximum likelihood were R will estimate the values of 
the intercept and slope that reduces the overall sum of the square of the 
residuals (i.e. the distance of the data points from the line).

We can do this using the lm() function which uses the Y ~ X notation


```{r}
mod1 <- lm(pen_subset$flipper_length_mm ~ pen_subset$body_mass_g)

summary(mod1)
```

The output gives a small summary of the residuals distribution (min, max, median
, and the 1st and 3rd quarterly). Remember the residuals are just the distance
of the data points from the fitted line. We can also see the r-squared value at
the bottom of the summary as 0.759 which was what we estimated above. The 
adjusted R-squared is a version of this value taking into account how many 
parameters there are in the model. For ou purposes we will ignore the final line
with the F-statistic and p-value for the entire model as we are interested in 
the intercept and slope of the model. 

The Coefficients part of the output gives the estimate for both the intercept 
and the slope of our best fitted line. In this case the intercept is 136.7 (when
you see the e+02 it means move the decimal point to the right 2 places). The 
slope of the line is given as 0.01528 (e-02 means move the decimal place to the 
left 2 places). This means the best fit line can be expressed as y = 0.015x + 
136.7.

The Std. Error gives a measure of how sure the estimate for the each of the 
intercept and slope is. A high Std. Error indicates that there is a lot of 
uncertainty around the estimate value. Before looking at the t and p-values lets
plot this line.



```{r final plot}

plot(pen_subset$flipper_length_mm ~ pen_subset$body_mass_g,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "Body Mass (g)",
     ylab = "Flipper length (mm)",
     bty = "n",
     ylim = c(0, 230),
     xlim = c(0, 6500))

#line with intercept of 136.7 and a slope of 0.015
#abline()
abline (136.7, 0.015, 
        col = "coral")


```

We can see from the plot that the line now fits the data very well. We can also
see that the line has a value of 136.7 when x = 0 which is the intercept (BTW 
when plotting you do not need to show the intercept at zero I am only doing this
to demonstrate the point). The slope of 0.015 also tells us something very 
important about the relationship between the body size and flipper length. It 
means for every unit increase in body size we change by 0.015 units on flipper
length. That is for every gram increase we expect flipper length to increase by
0.015mm.

However, we also need to test if this relationship is just due to chance, that
is we need to test if we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no 
relationship between body mass and flipper length. The linear model does this 
for every parameter so in this case there is a Null hypothesis tested for the 
intercept value and the slope. For the intercept the Null model is that the 
intercept is zero, for the slope the Null is that the slope is zero. In the 
summary the t-values are used to calculate a p-value for each of these estimates 
and test if the estimate values of these parameters is significantly different to
zero. In this case the p-values for both intercept and slope are well below 0.05
so we can reject the null hypothesis for both these parameters. 


# Checking the model assumptions

The standard linear model assumes the residuals are normally distributed so we
need to check this. We can check just like with the ANOVA using a qq-plot

```{r qqplot}

qqnorm(mod1$residuals)
qqline(mod1$residuals)

```

This looks generally good as the points are generally on the line. 

If you want you can further explore your model just by using plot(mod1) which 
will give you 4 new plots. The first plot (residuals vs. fitted values) is a 
simple scatterplot between residuals and predicted values.  It should look more 
or less random. The second is a qq plot like above. 

The third plot (Scale-Location), is 
very similar to the first, it should look random with no patterns. 

The last plot (Cookâ€™s distance) tells us which points have the greatest influence 
on the regression (leverage points). Points with high leverage are outliers that
if moved slightly could change the intercept and slope estimate the most. Its
a good way of pinpoint which data might be having an oversize importance in your 
model.


However, what if your residuals are clearly not normal, then what? One thing is
to transform your data.


# Transforming you data.

Lets create a scenario where the data is log-normal. To do so I will simulate
some data on body size and brain size for 100 species. The body size data is
randomly generate while the brain size data based on a model I made up, notice
how brain size is calculated according to the power of size. This relationship
will be reflected in our model.

```{r sim data}

#generate some random body sizes
size_g <- rlnorm(100, 10, 2)

#generate some brain sizes based on a simple scaling model
brain_g <- 0.1*rlnorm(100,0.01,0.4)*size_g^0.75 + rnorm(100,1,1)

```


Lets plot a scatted plot and the histogram of these.


```{r lognorm histograms}

plot(brain_g ~ size_g)

hist(size_g)
hist(brain_g)


```


These are extremely log normal with most values being very small while a few are 
extremely large like a blue whale. Lets fit a linear model of this and check 
residuals.

```{r lognorm lm}

non_log_mod <- lm(brain_g ~ size_g)

qqnorm(non_log_mod$residuals)
qqline(non_log_mod$residuals)

```

We can see the lower and upper quantiles of the residual distribution does not
match what we would expect form a normal distribution of residuals, this is even 
clearer if we plot a histogram of the residuals with most the values near the 
middle but a few values skewed left and right.

```{r hist lognorm resids}

hist(non_log_mod$residuals)

```


So what to do. One easy transformation is the log transformation. By getting the
log of all the values we compress them together onto a scale where outliner are
less of an issue. 

From a maths point of view what we are doing is changing the equation of the 
line from y = mx +c to log(y) = mlog(x) + log(c). Lets try this.


```{r log histograms}

hist(log10(size_g))
hist(log10(brain_g))

plot(log10(brain_g) ~ log10(size_g),
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "log10 of body size (g)",
     ylab = "log10 of brain size (g)")

```

These look much better. The data no longer increases is units of grames but in 
orders of magnitube. Since we used base 10 with log10() this means 1 here is 
10^1 = 10, 2 stands for 10^2 = 100, 3 stands for 10^3 = 1000 and so on. This is
called a log scale.Notice also that the data is much more like a line. This 
happened as the relationship between brain size and body size is actually a 
power law of the form y = x^m + c (have a look at my simulation for brain size). 
When we logged this we get log(y) = log(x^m) + log(c) which can be expressed as
log(y) = mlog(x) + log(c) which is the equation of the line. In effect we 
changes a curved line (the power law) into a straight line which makes doing 
statistics much easier. It also means that the slope in our logged model 
represents the power in the relationship between the X and Y axis.

Lets fit our model.


```{r logged mod}

logged_mod_1 <- lm(log10(brain_g) ~ log10(size_g))
summary(logged_mod_1)

```

Notice the slope is close to 0.75, which is the power I used in my simulated
data. The intercept is -1.14 (notice how I round up to 2 decimal places, this
is good practice) and both the intercept and slope are signifincatly differnt to
zero.

We can do all the other checks with the q plot here too.

```{r qq fixed}

hist(logged_mod_1$residuals)

qqnorm(logged_mod_1$residuals)
qqline(logged_mod_1$residuals)


```

This is better, its not perfect but you will rarely get that. There are still 
some values that are lower than expected (Note this may be different when you
run the code as the simulation has a large random element to it).

If we are happy with it we can plot our final model.

```{r final log plot}

plot(log10(brain_g) ~ log10(size_g),
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "Log10 of body size (g)",
     ylab = "Log10 of brain size (g)",
     col ="green4",
     bty = "n")


abline(-1.14, 0.77,
       col ="green4",
       lwd = 2)

```
